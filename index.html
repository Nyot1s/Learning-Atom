    <h1>My Passion for Technology</h1>
    <p>I grew up with technology. I remember using floppy disks on my fathers computer and being amazed on how things can change on a computer. I remember playing Real Time Strategy Games and was amazed that computers had so much power to make a game from the Command and Conquer Series.
      I still have this same passion today. I started after Highschool to get a degree in Electrical Engineering. I found that it was so much fun to start programming in C++.
